# Collections  
[Github Link](https://github.com/sijoonlee/algorithm_study) to find more information below

These are my own studies and study materials
- Standford's Algorithms Specialization Assignments Code in Python  
    Karatsuba Multiplication, Count Inversion in array in O(nlog(n)) Time and so on  
- Five Sorting Algorithms in Java  
    Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort  
- Dijkstra's Shortest Path in Javascript  
    Heap(min) structure is used  
    Given verteics, edges and the starting point, it will produce the shortest path between the start and the end  
- Maze Creation Algorithm in Javascript  
    A Variant of Depth First Search Algorithm  
    Max Heap Data Structure to keep path data  
- Heap(min) Data Structure in Javascript  
    Methods: Heapify, Insert, FindMin, ExtractMin, Delete, BubbleUp, BubbleDown
